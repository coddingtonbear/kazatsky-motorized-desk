# Kazatsky: DIY Motorized IKEA Desk

The project herein is everything I used for converting my manually-cranked [IKEA Skarsta Desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s49084965/) into a motorized one using parts from a cheap [Harbor Freight 18v Drill Master Drill](https://www.harborfreight.com/18-Volt-38-in-Cordless-DrillDriver-Kit-With-Keyless-Chuck-21-Clutch-Settings-62873.html), a DIY Atmega328pb-based PCB, a [BTS7960 motor driver module](https://www.amazon.com/DEVMO-BTS7960B-Stepper-H-Bridge-Arduino/dp/B07SZ4T699/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=BTS7960+motor+driver&qid=1570931471&s=electronics&sr=1-3), a handful of 3D-printed parts, and miscellaneous hardware.

You can also find the 3d-printed parts on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3912988

This is named after the traditional Russian folk dance called the "Kazatsky" because of the parallels that can be drawn between that dance's main movement and the comically fast speed at which this desk can be raised up and down when running the drill at full-bore.
